# spam-detection
 This is implementing the honeypot technique to catch spams. 
 There three methods implemented:
 
 Checking if a input does not exist
 Checking if an input is empty
 Checking the time a user took to submit a form.
 
 
The code is organised like a package manager. 
You are allowed to moved it to any directory you want.  

The language/framework is PHP & Laravel. 
The HoneyPot technique is independent of a language or framework

Enjoy!
